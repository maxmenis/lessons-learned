# Specifying Software - Job Story
I think that job stories are a great way to clearly communicate an idea or feature to you development team. 
Talking the same language is defintely a must, and through job stories you can clearly focus on the intent of the feature. 
Main Benefits:
- Avoid Confusion
- Express clear intent
- Create story/ picture of the situation
