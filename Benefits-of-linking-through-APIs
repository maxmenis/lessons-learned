#Benefits of APIs#
Sometime ago, I was part of team that installed Salesforce in the company where I used to work. 
It was a very interesting experience, working with expert consultants and customizing the many features it has to match the 
characterirtics of the company. 
The lat thing we did, which was perhaps one of the hardest, was to download APIs to create a "bridge" between Salesforce and SAP
thw software the administration used. 
Before attending the class, I though APIs were mostly to link 2 different systems (SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamic, etc).
I really enjoyed learning about APIs, and the easiness of connecting different sites through them. Things that seem very complicated 
are in fact somewhat easy and even some larger companies have "how-to-connect-our-API" files on their websites (Attaching a few examples)
Overall the API excercise was really interesting.
